# Java_Screenshare
A simple program that allows Screenshare between two Devices

Only testet with java 17.

Server:
java -jar -s -p <port>

Client:
java -jar -c -a <ip> -p <port>

I used TCP because I my marihuana consumption fucked up my brain so badly, that I haven't been able to implement it in UDP.
(Would be nice when someone could explain this to me!)
