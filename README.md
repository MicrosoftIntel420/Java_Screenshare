# Java_Screenshare
A simple program that allows Screenshare between two Devices

Only testet with java 17.

Server (Receives screen):
java -jar -s -p \<port\>

Client (Shares screen):
java -jar -c -a \<ip\> -p \<port\>

I used TCP because my marihuana consumption fucked up my brain so badly, that I haven't been able to implement it in UDP.
(Would be nice when someone could explain this to me!)

# Update
So before my question to this topic has been downvoted and removed from Stackoverflow, due to my question not being focused enough (wtf), someone replied to me, that my plan to combine TCP and UDP doesn't make any sense. 
I just leave this code like it is and call it a day. Enjoy!
